# ArduinoIrControl
Infra-red Arduino based virtual keyboard with serial communication, logs and some magic

###About

I want to create something cool that I could use very often. 
On English classes at Unversity I choosed "Microcontrollers" as topic for my presenation.
"It have to be good, have to make something..."
So I decided to covert some tea (yes, I love tea, not every programmer drinks coffee, blah) to code and hardware. 

# Features

- Can be used almost everywhere that have USB port, .NET Framework 3.5 or higher
- Can be used as "virtual keyboard", you can lay in bed and change volume or others by any of your InfraRed remote (only if you configured app first)
- ???
- By changing a bit of code (pls dont steal my work :C) this app can run other apps/programs, can HACK someone or just draw smile in MS Paint.
